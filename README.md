## 4seq
4 track looped probabilistic sequence generator
 
## Ideas for future features of this script:

### goal
to midi sequence 4 note sequences either on the same midi channel or on separate midi channels for eurorack midi interfacing

### functionality propositions:
multiple pages of functionality, each granting control of 1 property per arc/note

### the functionalities/pages:
1- sequence note probability (aka threshold) (the current  existing functionality and fundamental functioanlity behind prolly)
2- sequence length (from 1 to 64) (aka sequencer end offset)
3- sequencer start offset
4- select the note from a predetermined scale (the first sequence will choose the root note and the 3 other sequences will be selecting intervals based on the selected scale)
5- note length


perhaps more to come...
